# Brand-Radiator-Task

This project is a React responsive web application that uses JSON server as a mock backend. It includes a homepage, an about page, a contact us page, an admin page, a header component, a side navigation bar component, and a footer component.

# Getting Started with Create React App

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and run the following command to install and start the JSON server:

`npm install -g json-server`
`json-server --watch data.json`

Then run the following command to start the React application:

`npm i`
`npm start`

This will start the application on [http://localhost:3001] in your default web browser.
For testing the application use following command:

`npm run test`

# Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the header navigation or the side navigation bar to navigate between the different pages. You can also use the contact us page to send a message to the site administrators.
